Given an integer array, move all elements that are 0 to the left
while maintaining the order of other elements in the array.
The array has to be modified in-place.

Before:

index:   [0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8]
element: [1, 10, 20,  0, 59, 63,  0, 88,  0]

After:

index:   [0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8]
element: [0,  0,  0,  1, 10, 20, 59, 63, 88]
