Given a list of daily stock prices (integers for simplicity), return the buy and sell prices for making the maximum profit.

We need to maximize the single buy/sell profit. If we can’t make any profit, we’ll try to minimize the loss. For the below examples, buy (orange) and sell (green) prices for making a maximum profit are highlighted.

       buy                sell
[ 8 ] [ 5 ] [ 12 ] [ 9 ] [ 19 ] [ 1 ]

        buy    sell
[ 21 ] [ 12 ] [ 11 ] [ 9 ] [ 6 ] [ 3 ]
